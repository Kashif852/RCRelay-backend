        GET /products: Retrieves a list of available products.

#### Additional Notes
The project does not use a database. Instead, it operates with in-memory data structures.
For any environment-specific configurations, consider adding a .env file in the project root (currently not required for this setup).
Feel free to explore the project structure for a deeper understanding of its components.
